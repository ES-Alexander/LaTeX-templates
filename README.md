------------------------------

One of the hardest parts of using LaTeX is getting started with things that work. This set of templates aims to provide you with the starting point, so you can focus on the benefits of LaTeX formatting for your assignments, reports, and meeting minutes. With regular comments and all the functionality I've found useful so far throughout uni, you can either use the templates as-is, or use them as an opportunity to learn some LaTeX, and modify them to your preferences.

If you find a problem or think something could be better, feel free to raise an Issue on the github page (github.com/ES-Alexander/LaTeX-templates). If you think you know how to fix something yourself, commit the change and submit a pull-request for review.
